# 5-Players Tressette
 This project implements a variant of the 5-player Tressette card game in Java. The user plays in single-player mode with four other computer-controlled players. The game follows the rules of the Tressette variant with the "call of the 3," where a team is formed among the players.  Each player receives 8 cards at the start of the game. The leading player can "call the 3" of a suit to choose a teammate, forming two teams: one with two players and the other with three. The bots follow basic strategies, respecting the gameâ€™s rules. An interactive user interface displays cards and moves.  The goal of this project is to create a single-player version of Tressette, laying the groundwork for a future online multiplayer mode. It is developed in Java, with Eclipse as the main IDE.
